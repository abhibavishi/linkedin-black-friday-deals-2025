Why this exists:

89% of B2B marketers use LinkedIn for lead generation

But Black Friday deal lists are cluttered with random SaaS

I filtered for LinkedIn-only tools across 8 categories:
• Automation
• Analytics
• Content
• CRM
• Extensions
• Training
And more...
```

```
Top picks so far:

🤖 Reepl - 60% off AI-powered automation
📊 Taplio - Analytics & scheduling
✍️ Canva Pro - Up to 50% off
💼 HubSpot CRM - Always free
🔌 LinkedHelper - Browser automation

Every deal verified. Updated daily.

"Another Black Friday deal list?"

Yeah, but this one's different.

I got tired of scrolling through 500 random SaaS deals to find ONE LinkedIn tool.

So I built what I wish existed:
→ Only LinkedIn-specific tools
→ 8 organized categories
→ Verified discounts

→ Updated daily

It's live on GitHub (free):

The irony of promoting LinkedIn tools ON LinkedIn isn't lost on me 😅
